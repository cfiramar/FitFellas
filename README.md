FitFellas
An android game that encourages fitness

In this game the user gets to unlock various fun, cool, cute sometimes frightning creatures called "Fellas".
As the user trains by running, walking, weight-lifting etc, he trains his Fellas as well,
causing them to gain experience until they evolve.

In addition, everytime the user drinks water and reports it, he gains in-game gold.
This gold can be spent to unlock new fellas (or other yet-to-come features).

In the future, I expect to develop a combat mechanic, such that two users can battle, using their Fellas.
